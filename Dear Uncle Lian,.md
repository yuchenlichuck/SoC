Dear Uncle Lian,

​	Hi, uncle, it's almost a semester that I haven't sent you a email. Time flies quickly and half my university years have passed. And the studying time is still busy, but some good news that I want to share with you. 

​	First, I am doing summer research in Tsinghua Univeristy in Beijing now and it lasts about 6 weeks.  Though I am in laboratory from not computer science but mechanical engineering, I do some cross-disciplinary work, which is relative to my knowledge like machine learning. And I definitely love the life in Tsinghua, since she's the top university in China, with friendly students and fantastic scenery.

​	Second, Although I didn't make it to google summer of code (a three-month program for open source project) , luckily this year Alibaba (阿里巴巴) also organizes summer of code for the first time, and I successfully applied in this program, and the scholarship is almost equal to the internship salary or even higher than it. So I haven't applied for other interns this summer.

​	Last but not least, this year my university started a semester exchange program to University of California, Berkeley. And I will have my first Tofel test in early September, so if my Tofel score is not bad, I can apply for this program in next spring semester. I hear that you are living in San Francisco, I am exhilarated if I can call on you in Bay area after about ten years. However, taking this program is also a choice with pros and cons. On one hand, I can enrich my international study experience  and maybe easily apply for summer research in America. While on the other hand, 

​	Now I have some plan,
